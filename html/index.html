        <p>Hey there! I'm Aaron/Chavster/Astra! I go by he/him pronouns and I'm an aspiring programmer! I make mods for KTANE and Balatro.</p>

        <p>This website was made to catalogue my programming projects, document my coding journey and function as a place to put my feelings!</p>

        <p>After me and my girlfriend broke up, I made this website to function as a good little competition for myself. That, and also I needed a place to blog that wasn't controlled by my ex.</p>

        <p>Currently, it's still <strong>under construction</strong>, and has slight mobile support, but I'm hard at work getting it finished! It should hopefully be done at the end of the month!</p>

        <p>Please take this classic GT4 song as a token of gratitude! (don't kill me :>)</p>

        <p>Reach out to me on <strong>GitHub</strong><br>
           @ <a href="github.com/Chavster">chavster!</a>

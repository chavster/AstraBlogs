        <p>This website was made to catalogue my programming projects as well as function as a place to put my feelings!</p>

        <p>Currently, it's still <strong>under construction</strong>, and doesn't have mobile support, but I'm hard at work getting it finished! It should hopefully be done at the end of the month!</p>

        <p>Please take this classic GT4 song as a token of gratitude! (don't kill me :>)</p>

        <p>Reach out to me on <strong>discord</strong><br>
           @ chavster!
